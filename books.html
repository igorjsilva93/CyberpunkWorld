        <img class="conteudo" src="imgs/Neuromancer.jpg" width="10%" height="10%" /> </img>
        <br><br><br><br>Neuromancer, by William Gibson, is one of the most famous novels in the cyberpunk genre, and won the three main science fiction awards: Nebula, Hugo and Philip K. Dick, after its publication in 1984, having been published in 1991 in Brazil by the publisher Aleph. This was Gibson's first book and the beginning of a trilogy.

        Neuromancer is a science fiction book that introduced new concepts at the time, such as advanced artificial intelligences, a Matrix network and an almost “physical” cyberspace, concepts that were later explored by Masamune Shirow in his manga Ghost in the Shell and in the film Ghost in The Shell (in Brazil, "O Phantom of the Future"), directed by Mamoru Oshii, this served as inspiration for the Wachowski sisters in the creation of the Matrix trilogy.

        <img class="conteudo2" src="imgs/Altered Carbon.jpg" width="10%" height="10%" /> </img>
        <br><br><br><br>A thrilling sci-fi thriller to be a Netflix series. In the 20th century, a person's consciousness could be stored in a cartridge at the base of the brain and downloaded into a new body when the current one stops functioning. Death is now nothing more than an inconvenient setback, a flaw in the program. Takeshi Kovacs, a former elite military man, after his last death, has his conscience transported to Bay City, the former San Francisco, and is brought back to life to solve the murder of a tycoon. This is only to discover that his contractor is the victim himself, who has come back to life in a new body, but without the memories of the crime. However, Kovacs does not know that this investigation will cast him at the center of a perverse conspiracy even by the standards of a society that treats human existence as a commodity to be traded.

    <h3>SNOW CRASH BY NEAL STEPHENSON</h3>
      <p class="conteudo2">
        <img class="conteudo2" src="imgs/Snowcrash.jpg" width="10%" height="10%" /> </img>
        <br><br><br><br>The story opens in Los Angeles in the 21st century, an unspecified number of years after a worldwide economic collapse. Los Angeles is no longer part of the United States since the federal government has ceded most of its power and territory to private organizations and entrepreneurs. Franchising, individual sovereignty, and private vehicles reign supreme. Mercenary arms compete for national defense contracts, while private security guards preserve the peace in sovereign, gated housing developments. Highway companies compete to attract drivers to their roads, and all mail delivery is hired courier. The remnants of government maintain authority only in isolated compounds, where they of the tedious make-work that is, by and large, irrelevant to the society around them. Much of the world's territory has been carved up into sovereign enclaves, each run by its own big business franchise (such as "Mr. Lee's Greater Hong Kong," or the corporatized American Mafia), or various residential burbclaves—quasi-sovereign gated communities . Institutions are far different from those in early 21st century America; e.g., the for-profit organization, the CIC, has evolved from the CIA's merger with the Library of Congress.
